XNA Game Studio 3.0 Unleashed book source code updated to work with MonoGame and Windows 10

###XNA Game Studio 3.0 Unleashed Code updated to Run under Windows 10 (and HoloLens)

I’ve gone through the first pass of updating the code in the book. This took quite a bit of time. Some of the chapters are still a little wonky as I’ve ran out of time. But I wanted to get what I have done out into the public in case it was beneficial to anyone.  I never really thought I’d update the code for the XNA Game Studio 3.0 Unleashed book. There were a lot of breaking changes between XNA 3.1 and XNA 4.0 and I just didn’t have the time to do it.

However, with my HoloLens being ordered, and hearing Tom Spillman on .NET Rocks last week. I decided to see what it would take. It was suprisingly simple to get quite a few chapters converted and upgraded.  Other chapters were just not attempted (like Networking stuff that isn’t directly in MonoGame). Others had to be commented out to work (like the GameServices stuff to bring up the Xbox Guide, etc.)
